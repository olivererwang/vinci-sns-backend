/**
 * "It's Dangerouser" is a pretty straight-up port of It's dangerous (stylized itsdangerous), a simple little thing
 * that can be used to generate signatures. It's written in python, though, which means I can't use it on things like
 * android. So, caught in a coffee driven rage that I could not use this library, I decided to port it to java.
 * <p/>
 * The original code can be found here: https://github.com/mitsuhiko/itsdangerous

 * This class contains all the static methods.
